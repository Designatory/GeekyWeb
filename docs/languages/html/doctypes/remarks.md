The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is not an HTML tag. It is used for specifying which version of HTML the document is using. This is referred to as the document type declaration (DTD).

The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is NOT case sensitive. To check if the HTML of your Web pages is valid, go to [W3C's validation service](http://validator.w3.org/).

- Some old versions of IE don't support some HTML tags unless a proper doctype is available.
- It's **vital** that a doctype is declared as to make sure the browser doesn't use quirks mode. [More info on MDN.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode)
