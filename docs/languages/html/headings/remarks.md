:::success Remarks

- An `h1`–`h6` element must have both a start tag and an end tag.<sup>[**1**](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/h1.html)</sup>
- `h1`–`h6` elements are block level elements by default (CSS style: `display: block`).<sup>[**2**](https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#h-7.5.3)</sup>
- `h1`–`h6` elements should not be confused with the [section element](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/html/311/sectioning-elements#t=201607262130086028708)
- Heading tags (`h1`–`h6`) are not related to the `head` tag.
- Permitted Content: [phrasing content](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/terminology.html#phrasing-content)
- The different CSS-styles for headings differ usually in `font-size` and `margin`. The following CSS-settings for `h1`–`h6` elements can serve as an orientation (characterized as 'informative' by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/sample.html))
- Search engine spiders (the code that adds a page to a search engine) automatically pays more attention to higher importance (h1 has most, h2 has less, h3 has even less, ...) headings to discern what a page is about.
