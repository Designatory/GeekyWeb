# HTML - Hypertext Markup Language

![Introduction to HTML](../../assets/html/introduction-to-html.png)

HTML stands for hypertext markup language use to create webpages using markup language, HTML is the root language for creating webpages, HTML's first standard version was HTML 2.0 and it is published in 1999, and today it is one of the most popular language, let's start exploring this language.

An HTML document consists of 2 important parts:
- **Document Creation** (what user will see)
- **Tags** (and how they see it) <br/> <br/>


##  Below Some Points are very basic but important

- The `<html>` is considered to be the head of the family, It' from this tag that the browser recognizes it's an HTML Document

- For every opening tag there is a closing tag like `</html>`

- The tag `<html>` is followed by the `<head>` tag, this is special one, and the content written inside is not displayed on the webpage, It comprises of the title (of browser window) or any other instruction, which you want to provide to the web browser for example:

```html
<head>
    <title>Welcome to GeekyWeb</title>
</head>
```
- the `<head>` tag is followed by the `<body>` tag, where the actual content that is visible on the webpage is written, i.e. all the visual elements such as headings, paragraphs, images etc. <br/> <br/>

## Questions

Before we move any further in this course, several questions may have popped in your head, well don't worry we can help you solve at least few of them. Let's start them.


### 1. How do Web Browsers interact with HTML?

Browsers are too proud, they just do not/cannot read the content directly from the place where it is stored, to settle this conflict, web servers are used. A Web Server acts like an intermediator, it patiently listens to the browser's request and execute it for us. The document delivered to the browser contains the HTML text which is displayed just by identifying the tag `<html>` from the document.

### 2. What make HTML so powerful?

As it turns out, HTML is a very friendly language and it is on good terms with almost all of the web browsers. It isn't needy and work out well using a simple text editor. It is the least complicated when it comes to search engines.

### 3. Is HTML is a programming language?

HTML is not a programming language well HTML controls the presentation, structure and layout of the data on a webpage, It just does not contains any functional programming logic. Manipulating data is not in it's nature, neither does it perform tasks like = event handling, taking input and displaying output, this is what make it different from a programming language.
