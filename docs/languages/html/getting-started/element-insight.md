Let's break down a tag...

The `<p>` tag represents a common paragraph.

Elements commonly have an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag contains the element's name in angle brackets (`<p>`). The closing tag is identical to the opening tag with the addition of a forward slash (`/`) between the opening bracket and the element's name (`</p>`).

Content can then go between these two tags: `<p>This is a simple paragraph.</p>`.
